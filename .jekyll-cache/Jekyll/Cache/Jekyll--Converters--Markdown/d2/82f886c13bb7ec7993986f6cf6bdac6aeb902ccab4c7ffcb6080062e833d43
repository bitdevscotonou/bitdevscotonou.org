I"ò<p>BitDevs Cotonou is inpired by the the original <a href="bitdevs.org">Bitdevs NYC</a> to help grow a community in Cotonou area of those interested in discussing and participating in
the research and development of Bitcoin and related protocols and software. You can be well
versed with or new to the topics, all are welcome. Be advised: discussion will
be technical.</p>

<h3 id="socratic-seminars">Socratic Seminars</h3>

<p>Our monthly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socratic_method#Socratic_seminar">Socratic Seminar</a> events are formatted to foster debate, information sharing and lively discussion. In the weeks preceding the event, discussion topics are collated by meetup members from a variety of sources: pull requests in popular git repositories (e.g. Bitcoin Core, lnd, c-lightning, Joinmarket, Elements Alpha, Fedimint and Electrum), research papers, technical blog posts, IRC logs, network monitors and more. To complete the meeting, members present open source projects, companies, research and other relevant materials. A feedback and Q&amp;A section follow. After the event the group gathers at a nearby restaurant to socialize.</p>

<p>An event page will be posted on this site prior to the meetup which outlines discussion topics. Archives of discussion topics and presentations can be found in the event descriptions of past meetups and on this web site. The discussion portion of the event is NEVER recorded. It is recommended that you have a firm grasp of the basics of Bitcoin in order to extract the most value from our Socratic events.</p>

<p>Please contact the organizers if youâ€™d like to present at a future Socratic event or have a recommended topic for discussion, or find the PR on the <a href="https://github.com/AlphonseMehounme/BitdevsCotonou">BitDevsCotonou GitHub repo</a> and add a comment. There are different requirements for presentations depending on the nature of the project. Check our list of suggestions for <a href="/topics">where to find topics</a> for future seminars.</p>
