<p>We are glad to invite you to this month <a href="/about">Socratic Seminar</a>!</p>

<p>Whether you are a full time developer, part-time developer, or simply curious, you are invited.</p>

<p>During this seminar, we‚Äôll explore the rabbit hole in more technical terms. Based on the explanations and points of view exchanged, we‚Äôll experiment with setting up a Bitcoin node on your personal computer and discover the node‚Äôs basic functionality.
