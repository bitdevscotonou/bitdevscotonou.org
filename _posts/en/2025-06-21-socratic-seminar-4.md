## Announcements

We are glad to invite you to this month [Socratic Seminar](/about)!

Whether you are a full time developer, part-time developer, or simply curious, you are invited.

During this seminar, we'll explore the Bitcoin rabbit hole in more technical terms. Based on the explanations and points of view exchanged, we'll experiment with setting up a Bitcoin node on your personal computer and discover the node's basic functionalities.
