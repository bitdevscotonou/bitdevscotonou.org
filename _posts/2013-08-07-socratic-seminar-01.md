This will be our first meetup. We will ease into it: we will lay out some basic
ground rules, make introductions and jump off from there.

Some topics we can jump off with: BIPs 70-72 (merchant services), off-chain
transactions, untapped features of Bitcoin protocol (MasterCoin/colored coins,
multi sig transactions, etc...), among others.
